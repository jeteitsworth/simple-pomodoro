# Pomodoro Timer
A very simple pomodoro timer that runs on Windows.

## Requirements
This script uses FFI to interface with libvlc.dll. That means you'll need to have the libvlc.dll. 

It can be adapted to run on Linux by swapping out the libvlc.dll line with libvlc.so.

## Usage
No script for easy launch yet. Run with `ruby main.rb` from PowerShell or Windows Terminal.
